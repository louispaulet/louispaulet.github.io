        <p>As machine learning evolves, various advanced techniques are being developed and implemented to enhance model performance and accuracy. These techniques include ensemble learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>
        <h2>Ensemble Learning</h2>
        <p>Ensemble learning involves combining predictions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. Common methods include bagging, boosting, and stacking.</p>
        <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
        <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks). It is particularly powerful for tasks such as image and speech recognition.</p>
        <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
        <p>Reinforcement learning focuses on training agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desirable behaviors and punishing undesirable ones.</p>
